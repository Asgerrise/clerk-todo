# Clerk Todo App

Welcome to my Todo App.

The purpose of this application is to have a simple and easy-to-use interface to write down and manage tasks. Within the application you are able to create, update and delete tasks. The tasks will be saved in your browser cache for future use.

## Tech

The main stack utilizes:

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) (Composition API)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Development setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as package manager. If you don't have it installed, go to their website to find the installation guide for your OS.

If you want to use another package manager, feel free, as there are no scripts in the project depending on pnpm.

To get started on this project, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run a local webserver
pnpm dev
```

A simple setup of eslint + prettier is included.
